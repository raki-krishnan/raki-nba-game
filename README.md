# NBA Team Draft Simulator

## Description
NBA Team Draft Simulator is a program that allows users to draft a team of NBA players and compete against a computer-generated team. The program calculates the results of the match by considering various factors such as players' age, abilities, chemistry with others, and an X-factor. There's also a small element of randomness to keep the results unpredictable and exciting.

## Installation
To install the NBA Team Draft Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nba-team-draft-simulator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Raki_NBA_Game
3. Run the program (make sure you have the necessary runtime environment set up):

## Usage
To use the NBA Team Draft Simulator:

1. Start the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to draft your team of NBA players.
3. Once your team is drafted, the program will simulate a match against a adaptive computer-generated team that drafts players from the pool of players you decided not to draft.
4. The results, along with your match history statistics, will be displayed at the end of the match.

### Features
- **Player Drafting**: Choose from current and past NBA stars to build your team.
- **Advanced Simulations**: Matches are simulated considering various factors like age, ability, and team chemistry.
